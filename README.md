# SentimentAnalysisNLP

The project is a sentiment analyzer that clasifies tweets as positive or negative, it also shows a live graph of the analysis of sentiment from a series of tweets.

This project can help you to get acquainted with the NLTK and scikit-learn libraries, exploring the principles of the Natural Language Processing.

For this project we followed the Sentdex tutorial to make a sentiment analyzer from Twitter. You can find the tutorial in the following link:
